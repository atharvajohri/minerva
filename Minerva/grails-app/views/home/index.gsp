									Born to a family of doctors on March 12, 1990, I never thought I'd ever end up as a tech enthusiast.<br> 
									I was introduced to a laptop for the first time in 1998 when one of my uncles gifted my mother an <b>IBM Thinkpad</b>.
									And so began my interactions with technology in the form of games like Chess and Age of Empires.
									
									What began as an obsession with gaming evolved into a thirst for knowledge on how to build them.<br>
									And after being introduced to the Web via a 56 Kbps Dial-Up connection, I discovered a world of ever increasing and limitless knowledge.

									If you are school student in India, you have to make a major decision at the age of 16 (class X). 
									It decides what you want to pursue in the future and the major options you have are Medicine, Technology or Commerce.<br>
									I decided to choose <b>Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics</b>, a decision which was heavily influenced by my elder sister.<br>
									I passed my subjects, though I failed to appreciate the beauty of what I was learning. 
									At that time, for me it was just a bunch of chapters stuffed down my throat. I will always regret wasting so much of my time.

									In 2008, I qualified for the Computer Science Undergraduate course at Manipal Institute of Technology, and spent 4 years trying to learn
									things that made no sense. But during these 4 years, I found something that I love to this day: <b>The Art of Programming</b>
									<br>
									I started off with C (which was a part of our curriculum) and learnt basic problem solving. And soon I jumped to OOP languages,
									specifically C++ and JAVA. I fell in love with the structural beauty of the latter.
									Java was only a basic course in our undergraduate course, but some flashes of curiosity later, I became aware about J2EE, and how I could use
									my favourite language on the Web and browsers as an interface to the rest of the world.
									<br>
									I completed <b>two technical internships at Tavant Technologies</b> (2009 and 2010), first one which focused on the Server Side programming (J2EE, JDBC, MySQL), and the
									second one introduced me to Javascript.
									By 2011, I was well versed with HTML, CSS, Javascript and common frameworks like jQuery and J2EE, and could build applications myself.
									My first ever deployment was Pingpong Planet (check it out!)

									In my final semester (2013) I interned with <b>SocialHeart</b>, a startup with 5 employees who were building an ecommerce site for NGOs.
									Here I was introduced to <b>Groovy on Grails</b>. Groovy was the perfect language for me, as it combined my Java and scripting experience with Javascript 
									into one language. <br>
									After working with SocialHeart for 15 months (and graduating somewhere in the middle), I decided a change was due. My learning curve at the (now 10 employee) startup
									had taken a dive, and work was no longer fun. I decided to work at the company that had introduced me to everything: <b>Tavant Technologies</b>.

									<div class="cc-title">Tavant Technologies</div>
									I joined Tavant as a full time employee in April 2013. Since then I have worked extensively on Javascript and learned frameworks like 
									Kendo, Knockout, KineticJS.<br>
									I currently work at Tavant, trying to learn something new everyday. But more than technology, I realize that the most precious experience has been
									to learn teamwork, something that cannot be gained from working in a small startup.
